# Project Topic: OSM, Photos, and Tours

The [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/) project collects community-provided map data that is free to use. The full data dump, known as [planet.osm](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Downloading_data), provides all of the data from their maps in a slightly ugly XML format, ready for analysis.

## The Idea

The OSM data set has a huge collection of things you might have seen while walking around the city: [Canada Place](https://www.openstreetmap.org/way/223635729), [The Steam Clock](https://www.openstreetmap.org/node/703754423), [a bench](https://www.openstreetmap.org/node/3789883495), etc. Maybe you have walked by these and not even noticed. Wouldn't it be nice if they were pointed out to you?

We have previously worked with GPX data: the file produced by fitness trackers, GPS systems, or anything else that tracks movements with [GPS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Positioning_System) signals (or related technology). The problem with GPX is that you have to create it. You are more likely to find geographic information in photographs naturally: [Exif data in JPEG images](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exif) can contain latitude and longitude data as well, and most phones automatically add it.

The challenge:

- Take a collection of geotagged photos representing my walk/tour/vacation.
- Give me a tour of the things I *should* have seen.
- Try to guess what is in the photos.

## Provided Data

I have downloaded the planet.osm data and done some work to turn the monster of an XML file into data that's more usable, `amenities-vancouver.json.gz` in the [provided data and code](https://coursys.sfu.ca/2022sp-cmpt-353-d1/pages/ProjectTourData). The OSM data was turned into what I gave you with the code in that archive:

1. Turned the monolithic XML file into a split files with its top-level elements one-per-line so they can sensibly be approached with Spark. (With `dissassemble-osm.py`, producing the data in `/courses/datasets/openstreetmaps` on our cluster's HDFS.)
2. Processed the fragmented XML, keeping only [nodes](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/OSM_XML) that are an “amenity”, and saving as a more reasonable JSON format. (With `osm-amenities.py` as a Spark job on the cluster.)
3. Extracted only data that was roughly within Greater Vancouver. (With `just-vancouver.py` on the cluster.)

If you would like to work with a different subset of the data, you can modify the code and repeat steps 2 or 3. You'd have to be insane to repeat step 1.

The data set is in JSON format, with fields for latitude, longitude, timestamp (when the node was edited), the amenity type (like “restaurant”, “bench”, “pharmacy”, etc), the name (like “White Spot”, often missing), and a dictionary of [any other tags](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Tags) in the entry.

In Pandas, the tags field will be loaded as a Python dictionary (mapping keys to values). In Spark, it will be loaded as a `MapType` of string to string (see `just-vancouver.py` for a schema).

## Other Data

The problem with the OSM data is probably that it's too complete. I don't need to know about every park bench that I walked by. To make this useful, you have to find the *interesting* things I passed.

The result: **the provided data is likely insufficient** to get good results. You might be able to combine with WikiData information (e.g. the Steam Clock has tag “wikidata” with value “Q477663”, referring to its [wikidata entry](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q477663)). Or with Wikipedia data (e.g. the Steam Clock has a “wikipedia” tag referring to [its Wikipedia entry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/en:Steam%20clock?uselang=en#Gastown_steam_clock)).

You may be able to do some clever processing on the OSM data to guess what attractions would be interesting to the user. It's possible that you can apply some heuristic to find interesting points (more-complete entries obviously get more attention) or exclude boring ones (like park benches and infrastructure).

## Notes

Remember this is supposed to be a larger-scale and more independent project. If your plan is to just re-purpose the idea from the exercises and do something like “find nearby stuff”, that's not much of a project and your mark will probably reflect that. We expect to see more creativity here to attack a more open-ended problem like this.
